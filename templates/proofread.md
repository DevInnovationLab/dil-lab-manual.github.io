## Proof-read the text

- [ ] All results mentioned in the text are shown in an exhibit (table or figure). If that is not the case, make sure this is intentional and no matching exhibit should be included.
- [ ] The value of all results mentioned in the text match the values in the corresponding exhibit (if one is referenced).
- [ ] All claims in the texts are substantiated:
  - [ ] Create a separate doc and paste in each factual claim.
  - [ ] For each claim, check that it is worded accurately and precisely.
  - [ ] For each claim, find evidence.
  - [ ] For most claims add a reference (see below how to check references). Claims which could be considered 'general knowledge' may not need to be cited.
- [ ] Abstract and introduction include a summary of results.
- [ ] Introduction and literature review take no more than five double-spaced pages (or there is a good reason why this is not the case.
- [ ] The data is described in the paper, including provenance, number of observations and descriptive statistics.
  - [ ] If any data was dropped, the criteria to do so are clearly described.
- [ ] Identification strategy is described in a manner that is intelligible to a non-economist.
- [ ] Empirical procedures are described in enough detail that someone could replicate the work.
- [ ] All words are spelled correctly (particularly names and foreign words).
- [ ] No sentences are unfinished and all comments have been removed.
- [ ] Names are used consistently throughout the text (for example, the same round of data collection is not referred to as both “midline” and “follow-up 1”; not referring to the same characterist as “gender” and “sex” in different places).
- [ ] Voice and person are used consistently throughout the text (royal we vs passive voice).
- [ ] Quotation marks are displayed properly (particularly when using LaTeX).
- [ ] Use of empty adjectives and adverbs is minimal.
- [ ] Word choice and sentence construction are not unnecessarily complex.
- [ ] All text inside tables was also checked.
- [ ] Someone outside the team has also proof-read the text.
