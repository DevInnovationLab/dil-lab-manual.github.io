# Touch whaterver you want...

It is easy to write a lot of code and not even think about why we need it -- which almost always is to interact with the data. The data is a key ingredient of research, so don't treat it as something distant and abstract. While sometimes it is necessary to blind yourself to parts of data that you analyze to avoid bias, as a default take an attitude of **working directly on the data**: the only way to actually get to know it is by looking at, handling, and probing it. 

**Browse and explore the data** to understand how variables are distributed, identify patterns, and spot problems. Do this before you start running regression or specifying other models which will add more layers of abstraction between you and the data. Knowing your data well will make it easier to interpret and understand the results of more elaborate analysis. Some useful first steps when looking at data include 

- confirming the unit of observation;
- creating summary statistics tables and distribution graphs;
- inspecting outliers; and
- investigating missing values.
