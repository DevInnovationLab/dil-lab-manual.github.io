## Think critically

Social scientists tend to be very well-trained to think critically about research design. Unfortunately, this training does not always entail thinking critically about how research design is implemented through code. 

**Before you start working with data**, you already know to ask yourself what is the objective of your research, what is the appropriate method to use given that objective, and how that method works. In addition to these questions, ask as well what is the ideal structure of the data in which the method will be applied and what is the most efficient way to code it. 

**While you are working with the data**, keep thinking critically about the results you are seeing and make sure you believe them because you know how they were calculated: open the data, read all results before sharing and interpreting them, check number of observations, understand how each function is treating missing values and subsamples.
