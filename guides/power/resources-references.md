### Further Reading

- The classic reference for randomization studies in economics is [Duflo et al. (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1573-4471(07)04061-2).
- [Athey & Imbens (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.hefe.2016.10.003) offer a slightly more technical and up-to-date treatment.
- A classic reference on statistical power is [Murpy et al. (2014)](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Power-Analysis-A-Simple-and-General-Model-for-Traditional-and/Myors-Murphy/p/book/9781032283005).
- Derivations for the formulas used can be found for instance in [McConnell & Vera-Hernandez (2015)](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/going-beyond-simple-sample-size-calculations-practitioners-guide).
- See [Czibor et al. (2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/soej.12392) for a short summary paper with many useful suggestions for field experiments in general.
